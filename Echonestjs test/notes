Posting tracks for analysis
is a HTTP POST req....

apprently can do with [request module]

Something like....(NEED TO LOOK UP A FULL EXAMPLE OF WHERE THIS WOULD SIT,
either in request module examples or the code for the echonestjs  module...)

{ method: 'POST', url: 'http://developer.echonest.com/api....track/upload?api_key=[KEY]',
  headers: {
    'content-type':
            },
  body : data
} /// but i think difference is POST needs header & body

Try analyze by URL first
need SC API key shit

soundcloud
url = "http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/"+str(track_id)+"/stream?consumer_key="+key

something along these lines
curl -X POST "http://developer.echonest.com/api/v4/track/upload" -d "api_key=H4RHH3GOJ1P4FJHXK&url=http://example.com/audio.mp3"
